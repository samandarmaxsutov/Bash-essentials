Goals:

- using reserved variables

Tasks:

- create a script that does the following:

    prints the name of the script
    prints all arguments
    prints the number of arguments passed to the script
    prints 2nd and 4th argument
    print the exit code of -eq operation on 1st and 2nd arguments (use [[]])

- execute your script like this: ./my_script.sh 1 2 hello world

- change the script arguments so that the result of the last operation (-eq) would be 0

- run the script again with new arguments

Self-check:

- first script run results:

./my_script.sh

1 2 hello world

4

2 world

1

- second script run results contain 0 as the last output
