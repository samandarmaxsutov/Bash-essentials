Goals:

- learn to use pipelines

- learn to use || and && operators

Tasks:

- write a one line command using || and && operators that does the following:

    creates a folder named Name_Surname 
    if folder creation was successful, creates a file inside, called my_file
    if file creation was successfull, writes "Hello" into the file
    if previous operation was successful, lists the contents of the file
    if any of the operations fail, print "Something went wrong"

- run the command two times

- write a command that outputs only users that have /usr/bin/false shell from /etc/passwd file and changes the shell to /bin/bash

Self check:

- first command returns the following outputs:

Hello

mkdir: Name_Surname: File exists

Something went wrong

- second command returns similar output:

nobody:*:-2:-2:Unprivileged User:/var/empty:/bin/bash

daemon:*:1:1:System Services:/var/root:/bin/bash
