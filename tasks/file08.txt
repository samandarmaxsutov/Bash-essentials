Tasks

Goals:

- practice if statement

Tasks:

- create a script called odd_even.sh that does the following:

    takes one argument
    if the number of letters in the argument is odd, outputs the message "Odd", else if the number of letters is even - outputs "Even"

- run the script first with "odd" argument, then with "even" argument

- create a script called my_script.sh that does the following:

    takes any number of arguments
    if there are less than 2 arguments, output the values of these arguments
    if there are more than 2 but less than 4 arguments, output only the last argument
    else output "Invalid number of arguments" message

- run my_script.sh with the following arguments:

    hello
    hello world
    pie is lie
    keep calm and procrastinate

Self-check:

- odd_even.sh script outputs:

first run: Odd

second run: Even

- my_script.sh script outputs:

    hello
    Invalid number of arguments
    lie
    Invalid number of arguments
