Tasks

Goals:

- learn to use while loop

Tasks:

- create console.sh script that does the following:

    implements console functionality - infinite loop that reads user input on each iteration
    supports commands:
        ls [dir] - lists the contents of specified directory
        pwd - shows the path to current directory
        hi - outputs "Hello <name of the current user>" 
        exit - ends the script

- run your script and test implemented commands

Self-check:

./script.sh

ls ~

script.sh

pwd

/Users/Uladzimir_Semiankou/homework
